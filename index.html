    <p><font><b>Kenneth Kabiito</b> is a handsome intelligent 27-year old Ugandan, currently a</font> <font>student at Makerere University, College of Computing and Information</font> <font>sciences, pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. He is a brilliant,</font> <font>innovative and results oriented person capable of outside-the-box thinking to</font> <font>create solutions to recurring problems. Kenneth is more of a scientist than an</font> <font>artist, as he loves, studies and practices basic and advanced sciences in his day-to-day life.</font></p><br><p><font>He was born and grew up in Kireka, a Kampala suburb, for most of his</font> <font>childhood. He also studied in pretty-much the same area, for his nursery,</font> <font>primary, secondary education. Only for his University studies has he had to</font> <font>venture out to Kampala (Makerere University). He aspires to become a</font> <font>leading software developer for mobile and web apps, and also for robotics.</font> </p>
